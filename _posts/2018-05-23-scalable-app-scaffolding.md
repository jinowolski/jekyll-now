title: Scalable app scaffolding
---

In further several posts I will describe process of creation high-available
scalable application scaffold on a cloud. My personal goal is to practice
horizontally-scalable technologies along with creation of small web
application. Using scalable architecture is of course an overkill here, but
hey, it's for fun and practice, so why not?

**Disclaimer: I am a newbie in most of these technologies. I have been
learning those during writing these blog posts. I hope they will be useful for
beginners or maybe evolve into some professional content with your
contribution. Please comment or send me an email to help me improve content
quality.**
